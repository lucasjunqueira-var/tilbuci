# TilBuci

TilBuci is a free, open source tool to create interactive content. From a visual web interface, you can gather your media, texts, and all content in the form of interactive "movies" that can be exported as websites, embedded via iframes, made available as PWA apps or even as mobile and desktop applications.

## Easy to use graphic interface

Use a drag-and-drop interface to bring your ideas to life.

## Web and desktop software

TilBuci is a web software with several multi-user features for collective creation. However, there are cases where local use by just one person may be necessary. With that in mind, we now have a desktop version, presented as a portable software that can be copied to your computer or even to external drives, without the need for installation. The portable version is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS (x64-based architectures). Note that when performing in this way, TilBuci's server functions, such as visitor identification (login) or cloud data storage, will not be available, but creations made in the desktop version can be easily exported and imported to a server installation in the usual way.

## Javascript disclaimer

TilBuci is provided in the form of a Javascript archive. Even though the non-minified version is distributed together with the compressed one, it should not be considered the preferred format of this project: use the code in this repository as the source. It is written in Haxe and then converted to Javascript.

The base software does not make any requests to domains other than the one where it is installed, not even to TilBuci's own website, as can be seen in the source code. Plugins can be used to meet the need for connections to other domains. Whenever a new movie is loaded by TilBuci, information about which plugins are currently active is traced in the browser console. This way, visitors can confirm whether the content they are viewing is made only with the base software or if a plugin is used.

## Visitor tracking disclaimer

TilBuci offers features for tracking visitors' access to content. If visitor identification is not used (another feature available in the software that asks for visitor confirmation during a login process), the information recorded does not contain data that can be used to identify the visitor, not even as loose as IP addresses. Plugins, however, such as Google Analytics, may be used by content creators for this tracking.

## A free, open-source tool

TilBuci is a free, open source tool, licensed under MPL 2.0, developed using [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org/), [FeathersUI](https://feathersui.com/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/) among other technologies. The software is dedicated to all the joy Buci, a messy and often quite insane dog, brings to our daily lives ;-)
